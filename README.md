## Unpacker (v0.2)

Run [Unpacker.py](Unpacker.py). It can unpack images, get language strings and split them to different files and languages
from ripped assets of game.

### Old method for images

In folder _**Images**_ create _**.env**_ file with `ASSETS_FOLDER = *path_to_assets*`, where _path_to_assets_ leads to
assets (Resources folder:  `...\VampireSurvivors\ExportedProject\Assets\Resources`) ripped from game with "_Sprite Export Format_" as
_**Texture**_.
