## Unpacker (v0.5)

Run [Unpacker.py](Unpacker.py). It can unpack images, get language strings and split them to different files and languages, 
unpack images based in data files and make them with unifed names,
using files from ripped assets of game.

### Old method for images

In folder _**Images**_ create _**.env**_ file with `ASSETS_FOLDER = *path_to_assets*`, where _path_to_assets_ leads to
assets (Resources folder:  `...\VampireSurvivors\ExportedProject\Assets`) ripped from game with "_Sprite Export Format_" as
_**Texture**_.
